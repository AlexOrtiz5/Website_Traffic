# Project Description
  The dataset utilized in this analysis, sourced from Kaggle's 'Website Traffic' dataset, provides a comprehensive snapshot of user interactions on a website. It encompasses a variety of metrics designed to capture user behavior and website performance. The dataset's characteristics include a mix of numerical and categorical data, featuring columns such as 'Page Views' (representing the number of pages a user visited), 'Session Duration' (measuring the length of user sessions), 'Bounce Rate' (indicating the percentage of single-page sessions), 'Traffic Source' (detailing how users arrived at the website), 'Time on Page' (capturing the duration users spent on individual pages), 'Previous Visits' (counting the number of prior visits by a user), and 'Conversion Rate' (reflecting the percentage of users who completed a desired action). These features collectively offer a rich foundation for understanding website traffic patterns and user engagement."
